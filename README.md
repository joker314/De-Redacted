# De-Redacted
When you redact something, you probably do it wrong. This tools focuses on a rarer issue, extracting data from the /length/ of a block of redacted text. This is useful in file paths, as if you are redacting a directory, the slashes can be used to precisely measure length. Anyway, this thing does a brute force knowing the proprtional-ness of the font gives information away.
